Orchid was heavily inspired by Jekyll, and the official [Orchid Posts](https://github.com/JavaEden/OrchidPosts) Extension
adds Jekyll-like blogging functionality to Orchid. Choose the dates for publishing your blog post, create a listing of
newest posts on your home page, browse the archives, and much more.
 
 Orchid Posts is still under development and all features listed above may not be fully working just yet.
