One of the really special features of Orchid is its ability to link together multiple sites as one. Each site produces
a JSON file with an index of its library's declared classes, and including a link to this file from your projects 
`data/additionalClasses.yml` will read those classes and make links to those types when they are encountered in your 
project. These classes will also be added to the list of known subclasses or interface implementations.
