<span><h3 class="s">The Deity of Jesus Christ</h3>
<p class="p"><sup id="John.1.1" class="v">1</sup>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.2" class="v">2</sup>He was in the beginning with God.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.3" class="v">3</sup>All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.4" class="v">4</sup>In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.5" class="v">5</sup>The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.</p>
<h3 class="s">The Witness John</h3>
<p class="b"></p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.6" class="v">6</sup>There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.7" class="v">7</sup>He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.8" class="v">8</sup>He was not the Light, but <span class="it">he came</span> to testify about the Light.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.9" class="v">9</sup>There was the true Light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.10" class="v">10</sup>He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.11" class="v">11</sup>He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.12" class="v">12</sup>But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, <span class="it">even</span> to those who believe in His name,</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.13" class="v">13</sup>who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
<h3 class="s">The Word Made Flesh</h3>
<p class="b"></p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.14" class="v">14</sup>And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.15" class="v">15</sup>John *testified about Him and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.’”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.16" class="v">16</sup>For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.17" class="v">17</sup>For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.18" class="v">18</sup>No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained <span class="it">Him.</span></p>
<h3 class="s">The Testimony of John</h3>
<p class="b"></p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.19" class="v">19</sup>This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.20" class="v">20</sup>And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.21" class="v">21</sup>They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he *said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.22" class="v">22</sup>Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.23" class="v">23</sup>He said, “I am <span class="sc">A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS</span>, ‘M<span class="sc">AKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE</span> L<span class="sc">ORD</span>,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.24" class="v">24</sup>Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.25" class="v">25</sup>They asked him, and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.26" class="v">26</sup>John answered them saying, “I baptize in water, <span class="it">but</span> among you stands One whom you do not know.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.27" class="v">27</sup>“<span class="it">It is</span> He who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.28" class="v">28</sup>These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.29" class="v">29</sup>The next day he *saw Jesus coming to him and *said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.30" class="v">30</sup>“This is He on behalf of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.’</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.31" class="v">31</sup>“I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water.”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.32" class="v">32</sup>John testified saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.33" class="v">33</sup>“I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.34" class="v">34</sup>“I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.”</p>
<h3 class="s">Jesus’ Public Ministry, First Converts</h3>
<p class="b"></p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.35" class="v">35</sup>Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.36" class="v">36</sup>and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and *said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.37" class="v">37</sup>The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.38" class="v">38</sup>And Jesus turned and saw them following, and *said to them, <span class="wj">“What do you seek?”</span> They said to Him, “Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.39" class="v">39</sup>He *said to them, <span class="wj">“Come, and you will see.”</span> So they came and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.40" class="v">40</sup>One of the two who heard John <span class="it">speak</span> and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.41" class="v">41</sup>He *found first his own brother Simon and *said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which translated means Christ).</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.42" class="v">42</sup>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, <span class="wj">“You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas”</span> (which is translated Peter).</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.43" class="v">43</sup>The next day He purposed to go into Galilee, and He *found Philip. And Jesus *said to him, <span class="wj">“Follow Me.”</span></p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.44" class="v">44</sup>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.45" class="v">45</sup>Philip *found Nathanael and *said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and <span class="it">also</span> the Prophets wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.46" class="v">46</sup>Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip *said to him, “Come and see.”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.47" class="v">47</sup>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and *said of him, <span class="wj">“Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!”</span></p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.48" class="v">48</sup>Nathanael *said to Him, “How do You know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, <span class="wj">“Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</span></p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.49" class="v">49</sup>Nathanael answered Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.”</p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.50" class="v">50</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, <span class="wj">“Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”</span></p> <p class="p"><sup id="John.1.51" class="v">51</sup>And He *said to him, <span class="wj">“Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”</span></p><br/><i>
