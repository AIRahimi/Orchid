Pages within your wiki can be written just as any other kind of content. The file extension determines which compiler
should be used to process the content within, and any compiler can be used with Orchid Wiki, so long as it has been
registered properly. No restrictions have been placed on the content or extension of a file within your wiki.

Data from the rest of the Orchid build can be injected into your wiki pages by using YAML Front Matter. Refer to the 
[Orchid documentation](#) for more about YAML Front Matter, how it works within Orchid, and the kinds of data that
can be accessed within Front Matter.
