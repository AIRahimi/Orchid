The Glossary works in the same way as the [Gitbook Glossary](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/lexicon.html). Below is the 
documentation from the official Gitbook toolchain docs:

<hr>

> # Glossary
> Allows you to specify terms and their respective definitions to be displayed as annotations. Based on those terms, 
> GitBook will automatically build an index and highlight those terms in pages. The GLOSSARY.md format is a list of h2 
> headings, along with a description paragraph:
> 
> ```
> ## Term
> Definition for this term
> 
> ## Another term
> With it's definition, this can contain bold text
> and all other kinds of inline markup ...
> ```
