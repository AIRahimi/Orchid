Orchid Wiki is an extension for Orchid which adds navigable wiki pages to your site. It uses a familiar construction
style, taking inspiration from Gitbook. 

Wiki pages created with Orchid Wiki can be written using any language you choose, so long as the appropriate compiler 
exists in your Orchid site. By default Orchid ships with a Markdown compiler, allowing all pages within the Wiki to be
written purely in Markdown, but support for other languages, such as AsciiDoc or Textile, can be added with additional
Orchid extensions.
