[Orchid Wiki](https://github.com/JavaEden/OrchidWiki) is an official Extension for Orchid which adds Gitbook-like wiki
publishing to your Orchid site. Create a glossary of terms and summary page which enumerates your wiki, and let Orchid 
Wiki lead your users to a full understanding of your library. In fact, the pages you're reading right now were created 
with Orchid Wiki!

Orchid Wiki is still under development and all features listed above may not be fully working just yet.
