Orchid is designed for extensibility, and new functionality can be easily added. The core Orchid library only produces
webpages from Javadoc comments, but official Extensions exist for rendering static pages, blog posts, and a wiki. 
Including an extension as part of your site is as simple as declaring it as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file and
then creating the content for that extension.
